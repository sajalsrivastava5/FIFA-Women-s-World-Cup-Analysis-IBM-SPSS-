**Project Title: FIFA Women's World Cup Analysis**

**Description:**
This project aims to analyze the performance of teams in the FIFA Women's World Cup using IBM SPSS. By examining various statistical factors such as goals scored, possession percentages, and match outcomes, this analysis seeks to uncover insights into team strategies, player performances, and tournament trends.

**Key Features:**
1. **Data Collection:** Gathered comprehensive datasets from reliable sources containing match statistics, team compositions, and tournament results for multiple editions of the FIFA Women's World Cup.
   
2. **Data Preparation:** Cleaned and preprocessed the collected data to ensure consistency and accuracy, including handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and merging relevant datasets.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted exploratory data analysis to gain initial insights into the distribution of key variables, correlations between variables, and trends over time. Visualized the data using descriptive statistics, histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

4. **Statistical Modeling:** Utilized advanced statistical techniques available in IBM SPSS to perform inferential analysis, regression analysis, and predictive modeling. Explored relationships between independent variables (e.g., team rankings, player statistics) and dependent variables (e.g., match outcomes, tournament performance).

5. **Insight Generation:** Derived actionable insights and conclusions from the analysis, such as identifying factors contributing to team success, evaluating the effectiveness of different playing styles, and predicting outcomes of future matches based on historical data.
